# Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment
## Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
## 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
